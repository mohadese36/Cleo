# Cleo - Portfolio Website

This is my latest portfolio project where I designed and built a website using HTML, CSS, and some custom images. The project focuses on creating a visually appealing design with a clean and responsive layout. 

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my web design skills, showcasing a portfolio-like structure, with attention to detail on user experience and visual presentation. The website is fully responsive and designed with modern web standards.

I plan to expand this project in the future by adding interactive features and incorporating JavaScript for enhanced functionality.
